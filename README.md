# GCP GCS Bucket Pulumi Module
## Key Features

### API Resource Features

- **Standardized Structure**: The `GcsBucket` API resource adheres to a consistent schema with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. This uniformity ensures compatibility and ease of integration within Kubernetes-like environments, promoting seamless workflow incorporation and tooling interoperability.
  
- **Configurable Specifications**:
  - **GCP Credential ID**: Securely references the GCP credentials required to set up the Pulumi provider, ensuring authenticated and authorized interactions with GCP services.
  - **GCP Project ID**: Specifies the GCP project where the GCS Bucket resources will be deployed, enabling precise management and organization of cloud resources.
  - **GCP Region**: Defines the region where the GCS Bucket will be created, allowing for optimized performance and compliance with data residency requirements.
  - **Public Access Configuration**: Flags to indicate if the GCS Bucket should have external (public) access, automatically configuring access controls based on the specified setting.
  
- **Validation and Compliance**: Incorporates stringent validation rules to ensure all configurations adhere to established standards and best practices, minimizing the risk of misconfigurations and enhancing overall system reliability.

### Pulumi Module Features

- **Automated GCP Provider Setup**: Utilizes the provided GCP credentials to automatically configure the Pulumi GCP provider, enabling seamless and secure interactions with GCP Cloud Storage resources.
  
- **GCS Bucket Management**: Streamlines the creation and management of GCS Buckets based on the provided specifications. This includes setting up bucket parameters such as location, access controls, and resource labels to align with organizational requirements and performance standards.
  
- **Public Access Configuration**: Automatically configures bucket access controls based on the `is_public` flag. If set to true, the module grants public read access to the bucket and its objects, facilitating easy distribution of publicly accessible content.
  
- **Exported Stack Outputs**: Captures essential outputs such as bucket IDs and access configurations in `status.stackOutputs`. These outputs facilitate integration with other infrastructure components, enabling effective monitoring, management, and automation workflows.
  
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Designed to accommodate a wide range of GCS Bucket configurations, the module supports varying levels of complexity and can be easily extended to meet evolving infrastructure demands, ensuring long-term adaptability.
  
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to promptly identify and report issues encountered during deployment or configuration processes, aiding in swift troubleshooting and maintaining infrastructure integrity.

## Installation

To integrate the GCP GCS Bucket Pulumi Module into your project, retrieve it from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo/gcs-bucket-pulumi-module). Ensure that you have both Pulumi and Go installed and properly configured in your development environment.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gcs-bucket-pulumi-module.git
cd gcs-bucket-pulumi-module
```

## Usage

Refer to the [example section](#examples) for usage instructions.

## Module Details

### Input Configuration

The module expects a `GcsBucketStackInput` which includes:

- **Pulumi Input**: Configuration details required by Pulumi for managing the stack, such as stack names, project settings, and any necessary Pulumi configurations.
- **Target API Resource**: The `GcsBucket` resource defining the desired GCS Bucket configuration, including project ID, region, and public access settings.
- **GCP Credential**: Specifications for the GCP credentials used to authenticate and authorize Pulumi operations, ensuring secure interactions with GCP services.

### Exported Outputs

Upon successful execution, the module exports the following outputs to `status.stackOutputs`:

- **Bucket ID**: The unique identifier assigned to the created GCS Bucket, which can be used for management and monitoring purposes.
- **Access Configuration**: Information regarding the access controls applied to the GCS Bucket, including public access settings if enabled.

These outputs facilitate integration with other infrastructure components, provide essential information for monitoring and management, and enable automation workflows to utilize the deployed GCS Bucket resources effectively.
